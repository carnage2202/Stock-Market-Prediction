# Stock-Market-Prediction
This is a Stock Market Prediction using Machine Learning and Linear Regression Model. You can choose whatever CSV Stock File to predict as long they have dates and other related data to your prediction. I have used the data of ADANIPORTS(2000-2021). 
This is a fun exercise to learn about simple linear regression, python, and using machine learning libraries like sci-kit learn.
